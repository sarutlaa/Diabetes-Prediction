# Diabetes prediction and cause analysis in U.S.

Project Objectives: Using the implemented models to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on selected features.
Cause Analysis: Interpreted the results from the models to understand the key factors contributing to diabetes predictions and identified significant features influencing the occurrence of diabetes in the U.S.

Project Workflow:
1. Data Collection: https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset-notebook
2. Data Pre-processing
3. Dimensionality Reduction: Pearson Correlation and Forward Feature Selection
4. Data Analysis through Modeling : Used ML models are  Multinomial Regression,  Decision Tree Classifier and  Neural Network - MLP Classifier
